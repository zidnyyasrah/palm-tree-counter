# Palm tree counter

A model that reads an image file containing palm trees in a plantation. It outputs a new JPEG image with numbered bounding boxes overlaid on the original image. Each box marks a detected palm tree, numbered sequentially from 1 onwards. Using YOLO11, automatically identifies and counts the palm trees. The resulting output image helps plantation managers efficiently track and monitor their palm tree inventory.â€‹
